# JWT Authentication Strategy

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The JWT strategy is used for authenticating users using a JWT.

In this guide, you'll learn how to implement the JWT authentication strategy in Passport.js.

## Installing Passport-JWT

You can install the Passport-JWT strategy using npm:

```bash
npm install passport-jwt jsonwebtoken
```

## Configuring Passport-JWT

Once you have Passport-JWT installed, you can configure it in your application:

```typescript
import passport from "passport";
import { Strategy as JwtStrategy, ExtractJwt } from "passport-jwt";

const opts = {
  jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),
  secretOrKey: "secret",
};

passport.use(
  new JwtStrategy(opts, function (jwt_payload, done) {
    User.findOne({ id: jwt_payload.sub }, function (err, user) {
      if (err) {
        return done(err, false);
      }
      if (user) {
        return done(null, user);
      } else {
        return done(null, false);
        // or you could create a new account
      }
    });
  })
);
```

In this example, we first import Passport and Passport-JWT. Then, we define a new JWT strategy. The strategy requires a `verify` function, which accepts the JWT payload and a `done` callback.

That's it for the JWT authentication strategy! In the next guide, we'll learn how to implement the OAuth authentication strategy.
