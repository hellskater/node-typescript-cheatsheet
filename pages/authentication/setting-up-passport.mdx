# Setting Up Passport.js

Passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. It's flexible, modular, and can be plugged into any Express-based web application. It provides a comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Passport.js in your Node.js and TypeScript project.

## Installing Passport.js

You can install Passport.js using npm:

```bash
npm install passport
```

## Configuring Passport.js

Once you have Passport.js installed, you can configure it in your application:

```typescript
import express from "express";
import passport from "passport";

const app = express();

app.use(passport.initialize());
```

In this example, we first import Express and Passport. Then, we initialize Passport and use it as a middleware with Express.

That's it for setting up Passport.js! In the next guides, we'll learn how to implement various authentication strategies using Passport.js.
