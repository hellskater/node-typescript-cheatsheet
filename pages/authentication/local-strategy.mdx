# Local Authentication Strategy

In Passport.js, an authentication strategy is a method for authenticating requests. The local authentication strategy is used for authenticating users using a username and password.

In this guide, you'll learn how to implement the local authentication strategy in Passport.js.

## Installing Passport-Local

You can install the Passport-Local strategy using npm:

```bash
npm install passport-local
```

## Configuring Passport-Local

Once you have Passport-Local installed, you can configure it in your application:

```typescript
import passport from "passport";
import { Strategy as LocalStrategy } from "passport-local";

passport.use(
  new LocalStrategy(function (username, password, done) {
    User.findOne({ username: username }, function (err, user) {
      if (err) {
        return done(err);
      }
      if (!user) {
        return done(null, false, { message: "Incorrect username." });
      }
      if (!user.validPassword(password)) {
        return done(null, false, { message: "Incorrect password." });
      }
      return done(null, user);
    });
  })
);
```

In this example, we first import Passport and Passport-Local. Then, we define a new local strategy. The strategy requires a `verify` function, which accepts the username and password, and a `done` callback.

That's it for the local authentication strategy! In the next guide, we'll learn how to implement the JWT authentication strategy.
