# Middleware in Express.js with TypeScript

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

In this guide, you'll learn how to use middleware in an Express.js application using TypeScript.

## Defining Middleware

Here's an example of a simple middleware function that logs the request method and URL:

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

const app = express();

const loggerMiddleware = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(loggerMiddleware);

app.get("/", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send("Hello, world!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

In this example, `loggerMiddleware` is a middleware function that logs the request method and URL. The `next` function is called to pass control to the next middleware function. If `next` is not called, the request will be left hanging.

## Error Handling Middleware

In addition to regular middleware functions, Express.js also supports error handling middleware functions. Error handling middleware functions are similar to regular middleware functions, but they have four arguments instead of three: `(err, req, res, next)`.

Here's an example of an error handling middleware function:

```typescript
const errorHandlerMiddleware = (
  err: Error,
  req: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction
) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Something broke!");
};

app.use(errorHandlerMiddleware);
```

In this example, `errorHandlerMiddleware` is an error handling middleware function that logs the error stack trace and sends a 500 response.

That's it for middleware in Express.js with TypeScript! In the next guide, we'll learn about error handling.
