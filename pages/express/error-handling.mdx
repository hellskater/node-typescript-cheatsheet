# Error Handling in Express.js with TypeScript

Error handling is a crucial part of any application. Express.js provides a built-in mechanism for error handling. In this guide, you'll learn how to handle errors in an Express.js application using TypeScript.

## Catching Errors

In Express.js, you can catch errors by passing them to the `next` function in your middleware or route handlers. Here's an example:

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  try {
    // Some code that might throw an error
    throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

In this example, if an error is thrown in the route handler for the root URL (`/`), it is caught and passed to the `next` function.

## Handling Errors

Once an error has been caught and passed to the `next` function, it can be handled by an error handling middleware function. Error handling middleware functions are similar to regular middleware functions, but they have four arguments instead of three: `(err, req, res, next)`.

Here's an example of an error handling middleware function:

```typescript
const errorHandlerMiddleware = (
  err: Error,
  req: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction
) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Something broke!");
};

app.use(errorHandlerMiddleware);
```

In this example, `errorHandlerMiddleware` is an error handling middleware function that logs the error stack trace and sends a 500 response.

That's it for error handling in Express.js with TypeScript! In the next guide, we'll learn about more advanced topics.
