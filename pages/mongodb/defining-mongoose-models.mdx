# Defining Mongoose Models

In Mongoose, everything starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection. Once you have a schema, you can compile it into a Model. A model is a class with which we construct documents.

## Defining a Schema

Here's an example of how to define a schema:

```typescript
import mongoose, { Schema, Document } from "mongoose";

interface IUser extends Document {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

const UserSchema: Schema = new Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
});
```

In this example, we first define an interface `IUser` that extends the `Document` interface from Mongoose. This interface will represent a user document. Then, we define a `UserSchema` that describes the structure of a user document.

## Compiling a Model

Once you have a schema, you can compile it into a model:

```typescript
const User = mongoose.model<IUser>("User", UserSchema);
```

In this example, `mongoose.model()` is used to compile the `UserSchema` into a `User` model. The first argument to `mongoose.model()` is the name of the collection your model is for. Mongoose automatically looks for the plural, lowercased version of your model name.

Now, you can create new users using the `User` model:

```typescript
const user = new User({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  password: "secret",
});
user
  .save()
  .then(() => console.log("User saved"))
  .catch((err) => console.error("Failed to save user", err));
```

That's it for defining Mongoose models! In the next guide, we'll learn how to perform CRUD operations.
