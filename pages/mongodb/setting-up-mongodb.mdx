# Setting Up MongoDB

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up MongoDB on your local development environment.

## Installing MongoDB

Before you can start developing MongoDB applications, you'll need to install MongoDB on your computer. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Download MongoDB**: Go to the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and download the MongoDB Community Server installer for your operating system.

2. **Run the Installer**: Run the installer and follow the prompts in the setup wizard.

3. **Verify the Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that MongoDB was installed correctly:

```bash
mongo --version
```

This command should print the version number of MongoDB that you installed.

## Installing MongoDB Compass

MongoDB Compass is a GUI for MongoDB that allows you to visually explore your data, run ad hoc queries, interact with your data with full CRUD functionality, and more. It's a useful tool for development, and it's recommended to install it alongside MongoDB.

You can download MongoDB Compass from the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

## Connecting to MongoDB

Once you have MongoDB installed, you can connect to it using a MongoDB client. In Node.js, you can use the MongoDB Node.js driver or an ODM like Mongoose to connect to MongoDB.

Here's an example of how to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose:

```typescript
import mongoose from "mongoose";

mongoose
  .connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp", {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  })
  .then(() => console.log("Connected to MongoDB"))
  .catch((err) => console.error("Failed to connect to MongoDB", err));
```

In this example, `mongoose.connect()` is used to connect to a MongoDB server running on `localhost` on port `27017`. The `myapp` part of the connection string is the name of the database that you want to use.

Congratulations, you're now ready to start developing MongoDB applications!

Next, let's see how we can use Mongoose to interact with MongoDB.
