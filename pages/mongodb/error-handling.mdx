# Error Handling in Mongoose

Error handling is a crucial part of any application. Mongoose provides several ways to handle errors. In this guide, you'll learn how to handle errors when working with Mongoose and TypeScript.

## Handling Validation Errors

Mongoose provides built-in validation for schemas. If a validation error occurs, Mongoose will return a `ValidationError` object.

Here's an example of how to handle validation errors:

```typescript
const user = new User({ email: "john@example.com", password: "secret" }); // Missing name field
user.save().catch((err) => {
  if (err.name === "ValidationError") {
    for (let field in err.errors) {
      console.error(err.errors[field].message);
    }
  } else {
    console.error("Failed to save user", err);
  }
});
```

In this example, if a validation error occurs when trying to save a user, Mongoose will return a `ValidationError` object. The `ValidationError` object has an `errors` property that is an object containing all the validation errors that occurred.

## Handling Connection Errors

When connecting to MongoDB, Mongoose will emit a `connected` event when successfully connected and an `error` event if an error occurred:

```typescript
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

mongoose.connection.on("connected", () => {
  console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
});

mongoose.connection.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Failed to connect to MongoDB", err);
});
```

In this example, if an error occurs when trying to connect to MongoDB, Mongoose will emit an `error` event.

That's it for error handling in Mongoose! In the next guide, we'll learn about more advanced topics.
