# Setting Up Sequelize

Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Sequelize in your development environment.

## Installing Sequelize

You can install Sequelize and the corresponding driver for your database using npm:

```bash
npm install sequelize pg pg-hstore
```

This command installs Sequelize and the `pg` and `pg-hstore` packages, which are the PostgreSQL driver and the PostgreSQL data types for Node.js, respectively.

## Initializing Sequelize

Once you have Sequelize installed, you can initialize it:

```typescript
import { Sequelize } from "sequelize";

const sequelize = new Sequelize("database", "username", "password", {
  host: "localhost",
  dialect: "postgres",
});
```

In this example, we create a new Sequelize instance with the name of the database, the username, and the password. We also specify the host and the dialect.

That's it for setting up Sequelize! In the next guide, we'll learn how to define models.
