# Models in Sequelize

In Sequelize, a model is the essence of an entity. It represents a table in the database and the actions that can be done on it. Models are defined with the `sequelize.define` method.

In this guide, you'll learn how to define models in Sequelize using TypeScript.

## Defining a Model

Here's an example of how to define a model:

```typescript
import { Sequelize, DataTypes, Model } from "sequelize";

const sequelize = new Sequelize("database", "username", "password", {
  host: "localhost",
  dialect: "postgres",
});

class User extends Model {}

User.init(
  {
    name: DataTypes.STRING,
    email: DataTypes.STRING,
  },
  {
    sequelize,
    modelName: "User",
  }
);
```

In this example, we first create a new Sequelize instance. Then, we define a `User` model with two fields: `name` and `email`.

## Using the Model

Once you have a model defined, you can use it to perform CRUD operations:

```typescript
// Create a new user
const user = await User.create({ name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" });

// Find a user
const user = await User.findOne({ where: { email: "john@example.com" } });

// Update a user
await user.update({ name: "Jane Doe" });

// Delete a user
await user.destroy();
```

That's it for models in Sequelize! In the next guide, we'll learn how to perform CRUD operations.
