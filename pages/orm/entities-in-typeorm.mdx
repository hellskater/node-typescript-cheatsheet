# Entities in TypeORM

In TypeORM, tables are created from Entities. An entity is a class that maps to a database table (or collection when using MongoDB). This class includes the table schema and methods for getting/inserting/updating/deleting records.

In this guide, you'll learn how to define entities in TypeORM using TypeScript.

## Defining an Entity

Here's an example of how to define an entity:

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column()
  email: string;
}
```

In this example, we define a `User` entity with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `email`. The `id` column is a primary generated column, which means it's a primary key and its value will be auto-generated.

## Using the Entity

Once you have an entity defined, you can use it to perform CRUD operations:

```typescript
import { getRepository } from "typeorm";
import { User } from "./entity/User";

const userRepository = getRepository(User);

// Create a new user
const user = new User();
user.name = "John Doe";
user.email = "john@example.com";
await userRepository.save(user);

// Find a user
const user = await userRepository.findOne({ email: "john@example.com" });

// Update a user
user.name = "Jane Doe";
await userRepository.save(user);

// Delete a user
await userRepository.remove(user);
```

That's it for entities in TypeORM! In the next guide, we'll learn how to perform CRUD operations.
