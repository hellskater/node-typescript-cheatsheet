# CRUD Operations in Sequelize

In this guide, you'll learn how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Sequelize and TypeScript.

## Creating Records

You can create a new record and save it to the database using the `create` method:

```typescript
const user = await User.create({ name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" });
```

## Reading Records

You can read records from the database using the `findAll` and `findOne` methods:

```typescript
// Find all users
const users = await User.findAll();

// Find one user by email
const user = await User.findOne({ where: { email: "john@example.com" } });
```

## Updating Records

You can update records in the database using the `update` method:

```typescript
// Update one user by email
await User.update(
  { name: "Jane Doe" },
  { where: { email: "john@example.com" } }
);
```

## Deleting Records

You can delete records from the database using the `destroy` method:

```typescript
// Delete one user by email
await User.destroy({ where: { email: "john@example.com" } });
```

That's it for CRUD operations with Sequelize! In the next guide, we'll learn about more advanced topics.
