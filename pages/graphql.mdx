# GraphQL with TypeScript

Welcome to the GraphQL section of the cheat sheet! GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. In this section, we'll cover how to use GraphQL with TypeScript, specifically focusing on the Apollo Server library.

Here's what you'll learn in this section:

1. [Setting Up Apollo Server](/graphql/setting-up-apollo-server): In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Apollo Server in your development environment.

2. [Defining GraphQL Schemas](/graphql/defining-graphql-schemas): In this guide, you'll learn about GraphQL schemas and how to define them using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL).

3. [Resolvers](/graphql/resolvers): In this guide, you'll learn how to define resolvers to fetch the data for your GraphQL queries.

4. [Mutations](/graphql/mutations): In this guide, you'll learn how to define mutations to modify data on the server.

5. [Error Handling](/graphql/error-handling): In this guide, you'll learn how to handle errors in your GraphQL server.

By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use GraphQL with TypeScript and Apollo Server. You'll know how to define GraphQL schemas, fetch data with resolvers, modify data with mutations, and handle errors.

So let's get started!
