# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with TypeScript

Welcome to the ORM section of the cheat sheet! Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you interact with your database, like you would with SQL. In other words, ORM is a way to work with databases using the same language you use to build your application. In this section, we'll cover how to use various popular ORMs with TypeScript.

Here's what you'll learn in this section:

1. [Setting Up Sequelize](/orm/setting-up-sequelize): In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Sequelize in your development environment.

2. [Models in Sequelize](/orm/models-in-sequelize): In this guide, you'll learn about Sequelize models and how to define them using TypeScript.

3. [CRUD Operations in Sequelize](/orm/crud-operations-in-sequelize): In this guide, you'll learn how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Sequelize and TypeScript.

4. [Setting Up TypeORM](/orm/setting-up-typeorm): In this guide, you'll learn how to set up TypeORM in your development environment.

5. [Entities in TypeORM](/orm/entities-in-typeorm): In this guide, you'll learn about TypeORM entities and how to define them using TypeScript.

6. [CRUD Operations in TypeORM](/orm/crud-operations-in-typeorm): In this guide, you'll learn how to perform CRUD operations using TypeORM and TypeScript.

By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use ORMs with TypeScript. You'll know how to set up Sequelize and TypeORM, how to define models and entities, and how to perform CRUD operations.

So let's get started!
