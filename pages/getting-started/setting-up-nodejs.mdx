# Setting Up Node.js

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Node.js on your local development environment.

## Installing Node.js

Before you can start developing Node.js applications, you'll need to install Node.js on your computer. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Download Node.js**: Go to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system. You'll see two versions available - LTS and Current. The LTS version is recommended for most users as it receives long-term support.

2. **Run the Installer**: Run the installer and follow the prompts in the setup wizard.

3. **Verify the Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Node.js was installed correctly:

```bash
node -v
```

This command should print the version number of Node.js that you installed.

## Creating a New Node.js Project

Once you have Node.js installed, you can create a new Node.js project by following these steps:

1. **Create a New Directory**: Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-node-project
cd my-node-project
```

2. **Initialize the Project**: Run the following command to initialize your project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command creates a new `package.json` file in your project directory. The `package.json` file is used to manage your project's dependencies and scripts.

## Running a Node.js Application

To run a Node.js application, you can use the `node` command followed by the name of the file that you want to run. For example, if you have a file named `app.js`, you can run it like this:

```bash
node app.js
```

Congratulations, you're now ready to start developing Node.js applications!
