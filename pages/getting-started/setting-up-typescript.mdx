# Setting Up TypeScript

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up TypeScript for a Node.js project.

## Installing TypeScript

Before you can use TypeScript, you'll need to install it. You can install TypeScript globally on your computer, or you can install it as a development dependency in your project. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install TypeScript Globally**: To install TypeScript globally, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npm install --global typescript
```

2. **Install TypeScript as a Development Dependency**: To install TypeScript as a development dependency in your project, navigate to your project directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -D typescript
```

3. **Verify the Installation**: You can verify that TypeScript was installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
tsc -v
```

This command should print the version number of TypeScript that you installed.

## Creating a TypeScript Configuration File

When you're working with TypeScript, it's a good idea to have a `tsconfig.json` file in your project. This file is used to specify various options for the TypeScript compiler.

You can create a `tsconfig.json` file by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
tsc --init
```

This command creates a new `tsconfig.json` file with a set of default options. You can modify these options as needed for your project.

Here's a basic `tsconfig.json` file for a Node.js project:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2018",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

In this configuration:

- `target` specifies the ECMAScript target version.
- `module` specifies the module system to be used.
- `outDir` specifies the output directory for the compiled JavaScript files.
- `strict` enables all strict type-checking options.
- `esModuleInterop` enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules.
- `include` and `exclude` specify the files to be included and excluded from the compilation process.

## Compiling TypeScript

To compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript, you can use the `tsc` command. If you have a `tsconfig.json` file in your project, you can run the `tsc` command without any arguments:

```bash
tsc
```

This command compiles your TypeScript code according to the options specified in your `tsconfig.json` file.

Congratulations, you're now ready to start developing Node.js applications with TypeScript!
