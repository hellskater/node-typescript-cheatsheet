# Defining GraphQL Schemas

A GraphQL schema is at the center of any GraphQL server implementation and describes the functionality available to the clients which connect to it.

In this guide, you'll learn how to define GraphQL schemas using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL).

## What is the GraphQL SDL?

The GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) is a language-agnostic way to describe a GraphQL schema. The SDL is used in the type definitions that you pass to the `ApolloServer` constructor.

Here's an example of a simple GraphQL schema defined using the SDL:

```graphql
type Query {
  hello: String
}
```

In this example, the schema consists of a single `Query` type with a single field `hello` of type `String`.

## Defining Types

In addition to the `Query` type, you can define your own types in the GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Book {
  title: String
  author: String
}

type Query {
  books: [Book]
}
```

In this example, we define a `Book` type with two fields: `title` and `author`. We also update the `Query` type to include a `books` field that returns an array of `Book` objects.

## Defining Resolvers

Once you have your types defined, you can define resolvers to fetch the data for your types:

```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => [
      {
        title: "The Awakening",
        author: "Kate Chopin",
      },
      {
        title: "City of Glass",
        author: "Paul Auster",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

In this example, we define a resolver for the `books` field that returns an array of books.

That's it for defining GraphQL schemas! In the next guide, we'll learn how to define resolvers.
