# Setting Up Apollo Server

Apollo Server is a community-driven, open-source GraphQL server that works with any GraphQL schema. It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Apollo Server in your development environment.

## Installing Apollo Server

You can install Apollo Server using npm:

```bash
npm install apollo-server graphql
```

This command installs both Apollo Server and the `graphql` package, which Apollo Server uses to build a GraphQL schema and execute queries.

## Creating an Apollo Server

Once you have Apollo Server installed, you can create a new Apollo Server:

```typescript
import { ApolloServer, gql } from "apollo-server";

// Define your GraphQL schema
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

// Define your resolvers
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => "Hello, world!",
  },
};

// Create the Apollo Server
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

In this example, we first define a GraphQL schema with a single query field `hello`. Then, we define a resolver for the `hello` field. Finally, we create a new Apollo Server with the schema and resolvers and start the server.

That's it for setting up Apollo Server! In the next guide, we'll learn how to define GraphQL schemas.
