# Mutations in GraphQL

In GraphQL, you use mutations to modify server-side data. Mutations can create, update, and delete data. In this guide, you'll learn how to define mutations in Apollo Server.

## What are Mutations?

In GraphQL, mutations are operations that can modify server-side data. Unlike queries, which are read-only and side-effect-free, mutations can create, update, and delete data.

## Defining Mutations

Here's an example of how to define a mutation:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  addBook(title: String!, author: String!): Book
}
```

In this example, we define a `Mutation` type with a single field `addBook`. The `addBook` mutation accepts two arguments: `title` and `author`, and returns a `Book` object.

## Defining Resolvers for Mutations

Once you have your mutations defined, you can define resolvers for them:

```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    addBook: (_, { title, author }) => {
      const book = { title, author };
      // Add the book to the database
      books.push(book);
      return book;
    },
  },
};
```

In this example, we define a resolver for the `addBook` mutation. The resolver is a function that adds a new book to the database and returns it.

That's it for mutations in GraphQL! In the next guide, we'll learn about error handling.
