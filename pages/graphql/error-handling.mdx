# Error Handling in GraphQL

Error handling is a crucial part of any application. GraphQL provides several ways to handle errors. In this guide, you'll learn how to handle errors in your GraphQL server.

## Handling Errors in Resolvers

In GraphQL, any error during the execution of a resolver function will result in an `Error` object. Here's an example of how to handle errors in resolvers:

```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => {
      try {
        // Fetch the books from the database
        return books;
      } catch (err) {
        throw new Error("Failed to fetch books");
      }
    },
  },
};
```

In this example, if an error occurs when trying to fetch the books, the resolver function will throw an `Error` object.

## Returning Errors to the Client

When an error occurs during the execution of a query or mutation, GraphQL will return an `errors` array in the response:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Failed to fetch books",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],
      "path": ["books"]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the `errors` array contains an error object with a `message` property that describes the error, a `locations` property that indicates where in the query the error occurred, and a `path` property that indicates the path of the field that caused the error.

That's it for error handling in GraphQL! In the next guide, we'll learn about more advanced topics.
