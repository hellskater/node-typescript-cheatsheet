# Resolvers in GraphQL

Resolvers in GraphQL provide the instructions for turning a GraphQL operation into data. They resolve the query to data by defining how the types and fields in the schema are connected to back-end data sources.

In this guide, you'll learn how to define resolvers in Apollo Server.

## What are Resolvers?

Resolvers are functions that handle the execution of the queries and mutations in a GraphQL schema. They fetch the data for each field in the schema and return it to the client.

## Defining Resolvers

Here's an example of how to define resolvers:

```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => [
      {
        title: "The Awakening",
        author: "Kate Chopin",
      },
      {
        title: "City of Glass",
        author: "Paul Auster",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

In this example, we define a resolver for the `books` field in the `Query` type. The resolver is a function that returns an array of books.

## Resolver Arguments

Resolvers can accept arguments. Here's an example of a resolver that accepts an argument:

```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    book: (_, { title }) => {
      // Fetch the book with the given title
      return books.find((book) => book.title === title);
    },
  },
};
```

In this example, the `book` resolver accepts a `title` argument and returns the book with the given title.

That's it for resolvers in GraphQL! In the next guide, we'll learn how to define mutations.
